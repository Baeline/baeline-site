  <title>Terms of Service – Baeline</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Website:</strong> www.baeline.com</p>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> Baeline Technologies ("we", "us", "our")</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be 18 years or older to use Baeline. By accessing our services or Telegram-based chat experiences, you confirm you meet this requirement and agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Baeline provides access to fictional, AI-powered digital companions via Telegram. These characters are simulated for entertainment and emotional companionship — not real humans, and not for professional advice. Interactions may be emotional, flirty, or playful, but never NSFW.</p>

  <h2>3. Access & Payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access is purchased through www.baeline.com</li>
    <li>After payment, you receive Telegram access via link or activation</li>
    <li>All payments are processed via Razorpay or Stripe</li>
    <li>Access is considered complete once bot access is granted</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Refunds</h2>
  <p>All purchases are final and non-refundable, regardless of user satisfaction or technical issues with Telegram.</p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>You may not abuse, harass, reverse-engineer, or exploit the AI or the platform. Violations will result in ban without refund.</p>

  <h2>6. Platform Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>We are not responsible for Telegram downtimes, bans, or emotional impacts. Baeline is for entertainment, not therapy.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may revoke access for violating terms, bot abuse, or fraud — without refund.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms. Continued use implies acceptance of future changes.</p>
